## Briefly About Myself

I started working in the IT industry as an SEO specialist.

After a while, I realized that this is not exactly what I would like to do. Therefore, I began to study Frontend Development. It seems to me that in this direction I can achieve success.I am also learning php and mysql at the same time.

My main goal is to become a Full stack Frontend Developer.

## Code example
**KATA from CODEWARS**
Description: I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 1 and 50.
Example: ```n = 3```, so I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string:
```
+++
+++
+++
```
### Solution:
```
function generateShape(integer){
  let str ='';
  for(let i=1; i<=integer*integer;i++){
    if(i%integer === 0){
      str+=`+\n`;
    }else{
      str+=`+`;
    } 
  }
   return str.slice(0, -1);
}
console.log(generateShape(8));
```
